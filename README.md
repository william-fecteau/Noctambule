# Description

You're a kid on a vacation trip in the woods, but you get real bored and can't catch any sleep, so you turned around and started catching cool night bugs instead! Explore the wilderness around you to disturb the quiet night life of the forest, get moths and sell em' to the local racoon to get better bug-catching equipment and gear and hustle up your bug-catching game by automating your newly discovered hobby, become the local racoon mafia boss you always were meant to be, today the forest, tomorrow the earth...

...Is what we would have said if the core gameplay was finished.

It's our first ever unity game, and it sure shows! with the manpower of 10 (minus one) drunks we achieved to make something that some might dare to be inclined to call a game, at this point in development we prefer the term "roleplaying that it's a game".

Our game has potential for integrating multiple gameplay loops, adding complexity to it wouldn't be a hard endeavor, but wasn't realistic considering the experience of our team. A better artstyle also would be really interesting. The main idea was to have a first loop of exploration, then a loop of automatisation.
